# Flight Ticket Price Predictor
This Project was developed as a course project for Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning course under the mentorship of Dr. Richa Singh.

## Description
- a Machine Learning Prediction model to predict the best model for Flight Ticket price and built a flask API endpoint that was hosted on a local webserver. The API endpoint takes in a request with a list of values from a flight and returns an estimated price.
- Trained the model with various Regressors like Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor after applying dimensionality reduction techniques with hyperparameter tuning.

## Technologies used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- HTML
- CSS
- Flask

## Deployment

- built a Flask API endpoint that was hosted on a local webserver. The API endpoint takes in a request with a list of values from a flight and returns an estimated price.
- We enter Departure Date,Arrival Date from the calender that will be shown while hovering on the Date menu. Also we can select places like Delhi, Kolkata, Banglore, Chennai and in destination we can select places like Cochine, Delhi, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata.
- In the stoppage section we can select after how many stations we want to stop like non-stop,1, 2, 3 or 4 and in airline section we can select airlines like Jet Airways, Indigo etc.
- After entering details, flight price prediction will be visible.
